As a Master's student in Data & AI at Epitech Marseille and a full-stack developer intern at ATC Immobilier, I use artificial intelligence tools daily. What many students don't realize: most of these premium tools are **completely free** with a simple university email address.

I've compiled here the 8 offers I personally use for my courses, projects, and internship. The combined value exceeds $500 per year — might as well take advantage.

## The 8 Free Premium Offers for Students

### 1. Google AI Pro for Students — The Most Complete

This is the most generous offer right now. Google provides free access for 1 year to their AI Pro plan (normally ~$20/month).

**What you get:**

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** — Google's most advanced AI model
- **Deep Research** — Automatic generation of sourced research reports
- **NotebookLM** — AI-powered note organization (turns your PDFs into podcasts)
- **Veo 3** — AI video generator
- **Jules** — Coding agent with extended limits
- **2 TB storage** on Google Drive

**How to activate:**

1. Go to [gemini.google/students](https://gemini.google/students/)
2. Sign in with your university email
3. Verify your student status

**Deadline: December 9, 2025** — Don't wait.

I use Deep Research for my Data Science research work. In 10 minutes, I get a structured report with verifiable academic sources. NotebookLM has become essential for studying: I upload my course PDFs and the AI generates audio summaries I listen to while commuting.

### 2. GitHub Student Developer Pack — Essential for Coding

If you code, this is the must-have offer. The GitHub Student Developer Pack includes over 100 free tools worth more than $200,000 combined.

**AI tools included:**

- **GitHub Copilot** — AI code assistant (normally $10/month)
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** — AI chat integrated into VS Code
- **JetBrains All Products** — All IDEs with AI Assistant included

**Other notable benefits:**

- Free domains (.me, .tech)
- Cloud credits (DigitalOcean, Azure, Heroku)
- Design and prototyping tools

**How to activate:**

1. Create an account at [education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
2. Verify your status with your .edu email or proof of enrollment
3. Activation typically takes 24-48 hours

GitHub Copilot is part of my daily workflow. I use it alongside Claude Code for quick autocompletion, especially on the [ATC Immobilier CRM](/en/projects/crm-atc-immobilier) I'm developing during my internship. For a complete overview of how I integrate these AI tools into my development, I discuss it in detail in my article on [how I use Claude Code](/en/blog/how-i-use-claude-code).

### 3. Microsoft Copilot for Students — The Office Ecosystem

Microsoft offers 12 free months of Copilot Pro to students, integrated into the entire Office 365 suite.

**What you get:**

- **Copilot in Word** — Assisted writing and rephrasing
- **Copilot in Excel** — Data analysis and automatic formulas
- **Copilot in PowerPoint** — Presentation generation
- **Copilot in Outlook** — Email summaries and suggested replies
- **Designer (DALL-E)** — Image generation

**How to activate:**

1. Go to [microsoft.com/copilot/ai-for-students](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals/ai-for-students)
2. Sign in with your university Microsoft account
3. Activate the 12-month free offer

Copilot in Excel is particularly useful for my Data Science courses. Analyzing a dataset with complex formulas becomes trivial: I describe what I want in natural language and Copilot generates the formulas.

### 4. JetBrains All Products Pack — Professional IDEs

JetBrains offers free access to all their professional IDEs to students, including their new AI Assistant.

**Available IDEs:**

- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate** — Java, Kotlin
- **PyCharm Professional** — Python

**How to activate:**

1. Create an account at [jetbrains.com/community/education](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/)
2. Verify with your university email or ISIC card
3. Renewable every year while you're a student

I use WebStorm for my TypeScript/React projects when I'm not on VS Code. JetBrains' AI Assistant is less powerful than Copilot, but the native integration with the IDE's refactoring features is excellent.

### 5. Perplexity Pro — AI-Augmented Research

Perplexity offers their Pro plan free to students through the Comet program.

**What you get:**

- Unlimited searches with cited sources

2. Sign up with your university email
3. Download Comet if you want the browser

Perplexity is my main tool for academic research. Unlike ChatGPT, it systematically cites its sources — essential when you need to reference in a thesis or report. I also use it to stay up to date on the latest advances in machine learning.

### 6. Figma Education — Professional Design

Figma offers their Professional plan free to students and educators.

**What you get:**

2. Verify your status with your university email
3. Immediate access after verification

I used Figma to design the mockups for the [ATC Immobilier CRM](/en/projects/crm-atc-immobilier) before moving to code. Dev Mode is particularly useful: it directly generates CSS properties and design tokens, which speeds up integration.

Note: Figma AI is not included in the Education plan, but the basic features are more than sufficient.

2. Sign up with your university email
3. Automatic or manual verification depending on institution

Canva is my default tool for project presentations. Magic Design generates a consistent template from a simple brief, and I just need to adjust the content. Considerable time savings on defenses.

### 8. Notion Education — Augmented Productivity

Notion offers their Plus plan free to students, including Notion AI.

**What you get:**

- **Notion AI** — Integrated AI assistant (normally $10/month extra)

3. Plus plan is automatically activated

Notion centralizes all my organization: courses, projects, meeting notes for my internship. The integrated AI allows me to quickly summarize long documents or generate structured study plans.

## My Workflow with These Tools

After several months of use, here's how I've integrated these tools into my daily routine:

**For a development project (internship or personal):**

1. **Research** — Perplexity to explore technical solutions with sources
2. **Architecture** — Claude Code in Plan mode to structure the approach
3. **Design** — Figma for UI/UX mockups
4. **Code** — VS Code with GitHub Copilot + Claude Code
5. **Documentation** — Notion to centralize specs and decisions

**For academic work:**

1. **Research** — Perplexity Pro + Google Deep Research
2. **Organization** — NotebookLM to synthesize sources
3. **Writing** — Word with Copilot for structure
4. **Presentation** — Canva for slides

This workflow saves me several hours per week. The important thing is not to scatter your attention: each tool has its specific role.

## Activation Checklist

Here's the order I recommend for activating these offers:

- [ ] **Google AI Pro** — Do this first (deadline: December 9, 2025)
- [ ] **GitHub Student Developer Pack** — Essential if you code
- [ ] **Notion Education** — For daily organization
- [ ] **Perplexity Pro** — For research
- [ ] **Canva for Education** — For presentations
- [ ] **Figma Education** — If you do design or front-end development

- [ ] **JetBrains** — If you prefer their IDEs to VS Code

---

## Practical Tips

**1. Don't activate everything at once**

Start with 2-3 tools maximum and master them before adding others. I made the mistake of activating all accounts at once and ended up only using half of them.

**2. Check your university's policies**

Some universities have specific rules about using AI in academic work. Do your research and always cite your tools.

**3. Renew before expiration**

Most offers automatically renew as long as you're a student, but some require annual re-verification. Set a reminder in your calendar.

**4. Combine intelligently**

These tools are complementary. Perplexity for research, Claude/Copilot for code, Notion for organization. Avoid redundancy.

---

## Conclusion

These 8 offers represent a combined value of over $500 per year, completely free for students. The only requirement: a valid university email address.

**Immediate action**: If you can only activate one today, choose **Google AI Pro for Students**. It's the most complete offer and expires on December 9, 2025.

AI is no longer a luxury, it's an essential productivity tool. These student offers are an opportunity to train on professional tools without spending a dime.
